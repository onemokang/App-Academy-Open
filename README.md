# App Academy Open
### Update: This curriculum was skipped because I took [Capital One Developer Academy](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/full-time-programs) (CODA)
CODA is a six-month, intensive coding training that prepares analytical, non-computer science students for careers in software engineering.
Skills I gained in CODA:
- Full-stack development like JavaScript, mobile, databases, cloud and API development
- Automated testing, object oriented programming (OOP), and microservices
- Other technologies like SQL, NodeJS, Angular, HTML, CSS, and more


## This is App Academyâ€™s Online Web Development Course.

It is also a part of the [p1xt guide](https://github.com/onemokang/p1xt-guides#tier-0---web-development---fullstack-bootcamp---app-academy-open) I am currently following.
